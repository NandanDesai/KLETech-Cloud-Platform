# My-Cloud-IDE
A Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) built using Docker. It offers a LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) stack and an IDE for web development. Multiple users can login and start development and each user will be provided with an isolated environment. When a user logs in, a new Docker container is spawned and is dedicated to that particular user. I built this as a proof-of-concept in just 3 days. So, things are pretty scattered in the code.

This project was a part of my 'Distributed and Cloud Computing' course.
