# KLETech-Cloud-Platform
A Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) built using Docker.
This project was a part of my 'Distributed and Cloud Computing' course and is currently stable. I have planned to add many awesome features in the future.
This project requires a lot of improvements in the code structure. Details of installation and usage will be provided later.
